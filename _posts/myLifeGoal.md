title: My Life Goal

I want to have this in writing so I can look back on it and see how I've done. This will be kept hidden in my personal repository and, unless someone is snooping through every commit or the post directory, will remain hidden. The basic layout of the plan is -> Make a bunch of money -> buy land -> build my own home/dwelling -> build a system that allows me to be as self sufficient as possible (ie live as cheaply as possible). While it seems ironic that the prereq for living as cheap as possible is to make a bunch of money that is how you get people to listen to you in America. The metric for success in many peoples eyes is dollars earned. The only things I'll buy once I make the money are things that will allow me to replicate a system for other to live as cheaply as possible and things that allow me to be creative. This is the 10,000 foot view and I hope to add to this as my approach becomes for nuanced and my first goal is achieved. A bunch of money in my eyes is less probably than what a bunch of money means to someone else. In my opinion, this idea could easily begin when I make around 1 million dollars. 

Upon further review, this has to be put into action before $1 million. I think if you get creative people will listen to you without making a bunch of money. If you did something the biggest little farm it could have an impact. Documenting my day to day vlog style would make people aware of what it takes. 

My current set up would have:

- 1 cow for butter and cheese
- 2 chickens for eggs
- Those are the only animals I would have. They would not be eaten for their meat but produce a lot of food on their own. Some sort of fecal repatriation would be nice for the animals but more difficult to do than for humans (because you cant tell them where to direct waste)
- I would try and build and underground dwelling at first becuase I think it would be the easiest/fastest. As you gain more of a following you could really start to do some cool stuff like some of the builds on youtube but for the beginning I think simple is best. 

Have not done too much digging on which crops are the most efficient (input to caloric output) but I would definatley like a diverse array. You dont want to be in hell. It has to still be a very enjoyable existence but it will certainly feel different. Like there are some things that are done at scale that just aren't worth doing on your own.

For example capital outlay at the beginning of the year would always consist of like a 50 lb bag of brown rice. I'm not gonna go through the trouble of growing that. Other things I could image needing propane, but it would want to be built up to solar panels. But for cooking the first hacky way would just be propane griddle. Induction heating is super nice though so I'd want some sort of electricity. I would even connect to the grid at first. 

I think the potential for this return to a different way of life could be a revelation for some people. I know there are people out there who are yearning for something different. In my opinion, life is very simple. You eat, drink, sleep, and socialize. But the global financial machine operates differently. Its requirements are virtually infinite. Each year it demands more and more as people become more 'civilized'. What I have laid out is far from clear but what I have in my head is extremely clear. I know what path I must take and I have a pretty good idea of how I'm going to get there. I think the impact it could have could be revolutionary. Sometimes, the simplest ideas are the best and I want to return people to a more simple existence. It will certainly not be for some people but for the people it speaks to it will be a revalation. 

The question is when do I fully persue this. I'm only 23 now and have made a few mistakes that delay this plan (hahaha). I think I want to try and live in a van for a bit just to see how my mental adjusts to a more simple lifestyle. Would also like to get some more exereience in the workplace. I want to meet as many people as possible and show them my mind and heart so that when the times I will have people vouching that I'm not some insane person. Farming XP for a few years I think will pay dividends when I'm fully persuing this vision.I think if I'm not getting the ball rolling by the time I'm 26 I'm doing myself and America an incredible disservice. That's all I'm going to add for now. I'll continue returning to this every so often as I think more about it.

Onward and upward.

In the hopes of learning some automation/data analysis skills I am going to begin learning the ins and outs of PyTorch, a python machine learning library. Because it is always easier to try and build something to learn a new skill, I intend to build a daily fantasy lineup optimizer. Considering I play Fanduel every week and make my picks on a whim, I figure this can't hurt. So I hope you enjoy following along with me on this journey.

11.4.20 - I will begin by making API calls to Yahoo Fantasy so I can retrieve player data.

11.5.20 - Upon further review I will not be using Yahoo's API for a few different reasons. They don't have the exact data I'm looking for, the documentation is underwhelming, and I think scraping will be easier. So I'm going to pull off all the data from https://www.pro-football-reference.com and input it into a mySQL database.

In the summer of 2020, I purchased a 12.9 inch iPad pro after discovering the joy of sidecar. The ability to have a duel monitor setup wherever and whenever I deeemed necessary seemed too good to be true. For some things I am willing to cough up the cash and this was one of those things. 

After around 4 months of use I can safely the iPad is the best device I have ever owned and like a fine wine, it will only get better with age. I used to keep notes in journals, then I kept notes on index cards in a plastic box, but the iPad has nullifed both of those things, and I'm better off for it. Now I'm not going to say that paper and pen does not have a purpose because it clearly does but what the iPad offers is just *different*. And before any of you claim that I am a Apple Sheep who buys all of the latest and greatest devices because it makes me feel superior to the other apple-less peasants, here is a picture of my cell phone. I have only bought the original iPhone SE on ebay since its release and will continue to do so until the iPhone 12 mini price drops below $300 (maybe the end of 2022).

Well that seems like a good enough rant for now. Here's a few pictures I've made with procreate.

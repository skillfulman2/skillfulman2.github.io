title: My PyTorch Journey
author: Ryan

In the hopes of learning some automation/data analysis skills I am going to begin learning the ins and outs of PyTorch, a python machine learning library. Because it is always easier to try and build something to learn a new skill, I intend to build a daily fantasy lineup optimizer. Considering I play Fanduel every week and make my picks on a whim, I figure this can't hurt. So I hope you enjoy following along with me on this journey.

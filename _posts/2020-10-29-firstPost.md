Hello whoever is reading this. I realistically should have done this many years ago (ok maybe not that many but at least two). But you know what they say about planting a tree, the best time to plant one was ten years ago the second best time is now. If I said I had a complete vision for how this blog/portfolio would end up I’d be lying. For now I intend to post things that I think are worth other peoples time to read. If I'm working on something I feel passionate about or think is interesting I’ll post about them here as well. Well I suppose thats all I got for now. Thanks for stopping by.

Onward and Upward

Hello whoever is reading this. I realisctially should have done this many years ago (ok maybe not that many but at least two). But you know what they say about planting a tree, the best time to plant one was ten years ago the second best time is now. If I said I had a complete vision for how this blog/portfolio will end up I'd be lying. For now I intend to post things that I think of and are worth other peoples time to read. If I working on something I feel passionate about or think is intersting I'll post about them here as well. Well I suppose thats all I got for now. Thanks for stopping by. 

Onward and Upward

I"’<p>In the summer of 2020, I purchased a 12.9 inch iPad pro after discovering the feature sidecar. For those unfamiliar, sidecar allows you to use your iPad as a second monitor for your macbook with or without a wire. Considering the amount of developement I had been doing on Global Gaming with my 13in macbook I was already in the market for a monitor. While the price of the 12.9 pad deterred me initially, the flexibility it offered ultimately proved to be the selling point. The ability to have a duel monitor setup wherever and whenever seemed too good to be true. For some things I am willing to cough up the cash and this was one of those things.</p>

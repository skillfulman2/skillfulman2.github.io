I"j<p>Life sometimes has the ability to throw a few curveballs, especially when things seem to settle down. On a cold morning in February 2019 I was doing what I had done for the last 6 months. Drive to work. Only this morning was a little different because there was more ice on the road than normal. I’m sure you know where this is headed so I’ll save the colorful language and just say I wrecked my 2003 Honda Accord into a white composite fence after taking too sharp a turn. This was the first accident (and hopefully the last) I’d ever had and I was just a bit shocked at first. Shock was very quicky overtaken by a weird mix of anger and sadness. After writing a note and leaving it in the mailbox a lady ended up walking out from the home that sat behind the fence and offered me to come in while the police came. She assured me that this particular event was an annual occurence; I was just the lucky contenstant this year. The cop gave me a ticket for failure to control and my car was towed with pieces dragging behind. But why would I be telling you this? Because it was one of the better mistakes I’ve made.</p>

I"í<p>I want to have this in writing so I can look back on it and see how Iâ€™ve done. This will be kept hidden in my personal repository and, unless someone is snooping through every commit or the post directory, will remain hidden. The basic layout of the plan is -&gt; Make a bunch of money -&gt; buy land -&gt; build my own home/dwelling -&gt; build a system that allows me to be as self sufficient as possible (ie live as cheaply as possible). While it seems ironic that the prereq for living as cheap as possible is to make a bunch of money that is how you get people to listen to you in America. The metric for success in many peoples eyes is dollars earned. The only things Iâ€™ll buy once I make the money are things that will allow me to replicate a system for other to live as cheaply as possible and things that allow me to be creative. This is the 10,000 foot view and I hope to add to this as my approach becomes for nuanced and my first goal is achieved. A bunch of money in my eyes is less probably than what a bunch of money means to someone else. In my opinion, this idea could easily begin when I make around 1 million dollars.</p>

<p>I have no interest in designer clothes, fancy cars or anything in like that.</p>

<p>Onward and upward.</p>

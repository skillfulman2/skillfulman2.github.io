# About page

My name is Ryan Remaly. I am a 23 years old and am always looking to learn and solve problems. My posts here will vary widely and I don't have an exact 5 year plan for how I want it to end up but that's ok. 

For fun I like playing all different types of sports and generally just being outside, especially when it's warm. My favorite book is probably Ishmael so if you have not read that I would recommend it. Favorite movie is Shawshank Redemption but my darkhorse is Fantastic Mr. Fox.
